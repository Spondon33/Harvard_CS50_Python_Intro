# conditionals

#1 if
x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
if x == y:
    print("x is equal to y")


#2 elif faster than using multiple ifs
x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
elif x == y:
    print("x is equal to y")


#3 else
x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")
